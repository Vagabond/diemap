============================================================

We're dealing today with the possible returns of two
phenomena that may cause some folks to lose sleep --
anthrax and politics.

Which is worse we'll leave for you to decide.

There's no indication that a bioterror attack is under
way or about to be. Instead, we're focusing tonight on
what happens IF it is. Is the U.S. any better prepared
now than it was in October? What happened to all the talk
about ensuring that communities are ready to respond? Has
the money been allocated? Plans formulated? We'll ask one
of the top advisors to Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge,
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

Then there's politics. The November elections and the
ailing economy have -- despite September 11's aftermath of
unity -- led to both parties sharpening their rhetorical
swords. And they're starting to get pulled from their
sheaths more often. This past weekend President Bush and
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle took aim at each other.

Is this what the country needs right now? Or is it a
healthy sign of a return to the normal give-and-take of
America's political system? We'll debate these questions
tonight with Susan Page of USA Today, Slate.com's Jacob
Weisberg and CNN Contributor Jonah Goldberg. We hope
you'll join us, no matter what party you belong to.
