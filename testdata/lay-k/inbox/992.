Wolf Blitzer Reports Wednesday
============================================================
Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will
have the latest developments in the war in Afghanistan.
As you may have heard, a United States Marine Corps
aerial refueling plane crashed today in Pakistan. We
will have all the latest details from our reporters on
the scene and at the Pentagon.

   During our 5 PM (EST) program, I will get analysis
from retired U.S. Air Force Major General Don Shepperd
and the former Clinton national security adviser,
Samuel Berger. I will also speak with Congressman
Darrell Issa of California. It was in his district
where authorities discovered an employee at a nuclear
facility had lots of guns and ammunition in his home.
How vulnerable are America's nuclear facilities?
I will ask Issa.

   On our 7 PM (EST) War Room program, we will assess the
state of the military campaign with three guests:
Rep. Porter Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee; Paul Bremer, the former U.S. ambassador at
large for counter-terrorism; and Robert Oakley, the
former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

And just click on http://www.CNN.com/Wolf to read my
column: "Bush and Kennedy: The Ultimate Odd Couple."

   Please join me today and every weekday at both 5 and
7 PM (EST).

   Thanks.

   Wolf Blitzer
