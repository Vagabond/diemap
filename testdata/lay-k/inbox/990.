Dear Dr Lay,

Now that you have received the Annual Meeting 2002 Programme Preview, we
would like to assist you further in preparing for various workshops and
interactive sessions.

The World Economic Forum and PricewaterhouseCoopers have developed an
innovative service on our website, the KnowledgeConcierge. The
KnowledgeConcierge allows you to learn more about a workshop or interactive
session in the Annual Meeting 2002 by providing a "state of the debate"
essay which frames the particular topic addressed.

As a further enrichment, it provides pre-selected links to key online
resources on the topic area. Finally, it offers a Personal Query service:
all participants in workshops and interactive sessions have the opportunity
to enquire further about specific issues related to programme topics. The
responses developed by a KnowledgeConcierge research team will be returned
to enquirers within a maximum of 24 hours.

The KnowledgeConcierge is now available by first clicking on the Annual
Meeting 2002 link in the Members' Area of the World Economic Forum's
website (http://www.weforum.org/private). Once in the Annual Meeting 2002
area, click on the programme link. From a workshop/session page, you can
access the KnowledgeConcierge by clicking on the "read more" link on the
right-hand side of the screen.

As a reminder, your personal username and password to access the Members'
Area are as follows:

Username: ldaly

Again, we encourage you to explore online the Annual Meeting 2002 programme
to prepare for your participation in New York.


Yours sincerely,

Lee Howell
Director, Annual Meeting Programme
